# COVID TRACKER

This is a very simple Covid Tracker based on a [Covid-19 API](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api) made for a school project

It is necessary to have *npm | yarn* installed and updated (to test in localhost use the command 'npm start' | 'yarn start')
All packages must be installed for proper operation

*For every problem, please contact: federico.bertossi@studenti.malignani.ud.it*
